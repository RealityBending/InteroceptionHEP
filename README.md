# InteroceptionHEP

- HEP  objective marker of altered bodily awareness (Terhaar, et al., 2012)
- HEP higher during interoception than during exteroception (Petzschner, et al., 2018)
- Good heartbeat perceivers had a higher effect of attention state on HEP than bad heartbeat perceivers (Yuan, et al., 2007)
-	Systole  associated with low perceptual sensitivity  longer touch. In tactile grating orientation task: duration of touch depends on timing in cardiac cycle Touches initiated in systole  held longer; touches in diastole  shorter. In control condition, no such effect. (Galvez-Pol, et al., 2022)
